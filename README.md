## Introduction

Ashbot is an in-development Discord bot using the discord.py library, initiated in January 2023. It aims to enhance user experience on Discord by providing a variety of functionalities through command modules, which will be expanded over time to incorporate more features. Ashbot is designed with the community in mind, aiming to facilitate interactions, improve server management, and entertain users through a wide range of commands.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Ashbot is built with a modular approach, allowing easy integration and updates of command modules to extend its capabilities.
- **In-Development**: Currently under active development, with plans to continuously add new features and improvements based on community feedback and technological advancements.

## Planned Features

- **Server Management Tools**: Advanced commands for managing server settings, moderation, and user roles.
- **Interactive Entertainment**: Games, polls, and interactive commands to engage community members.
- **Utility Commands**: Tools to enhance productivity, such as event scheduling, reminders, and information lookups.
- **Customizability**: Options for server admins to customize commands and bot responses to fit the unique atmosphere of their servers.

## Release

There is currently no planned release for my version of this bot at this time as it is still under development, and I am currently working on redoing the bot with more up-to-date library functionality.
